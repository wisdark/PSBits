# Introduction
A very special exe I use for teaching Windows Internals. It's a version 2, somewhat improved, but I have never published v1 though.  
It IS NOT harmful, you can use it on prod, but some AV/EDR may warn you it uses some suspicious techniques. It's true, as I try indeed to make it not too obvious. Matter of balance between looking good and being funny ;)  
The tool IS NOT persistent. Reboot clears everything, leaving two or three innocent files on your C: volume.  
NO ADMIN required. I want to play with you, and not destroy your computer...  
The file is (obviously!) digitally signed.  

# How to play:
The exe creates "secret.txt" on your desktop, and the challenge is to read its content. Sounds simple, but it depends actually on your skills and knowledge. Try it: run the exe, read the file, enjoy!

# The source code:

~~I will publish the source code (400LoC of C) in a couple of days. Publishing it right now would spoil the fun :P~~  
Enjoy the C source code :)
